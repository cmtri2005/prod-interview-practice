      "description": "This topic introduces the fundamental building blocks of data modeling: entities, attributes, and relationships. You'll learn to identify these elements in real-world scenarios and represent them effectively. Understanding entities, attributes, and relationships is crucial for designing well-structured and understandable data models.",

      "quiz": [],
      "description": "This topic explores the concept of normalization, a key principle in relational database design. You'll learn about different normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) and how they help to eliminate data redundancy, improve data integrity, and ensure data consistency. Applying normalization principles is essential for creating efficient and maintainable databases.",

      "description": "This topic focuses on the creation of Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams, a visual representation of data models. You'll learn to model complex data relationships using entities, attributes, and relationships, and understand how ER diagrams facilitate communication and collaboration in database design. ER diagrams are essential for clearly defining the structure and relationships within a database.",
