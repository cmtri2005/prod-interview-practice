      "description": "This topic introduces the fundamental concepts of Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes. You will learn the three core stages of ETL: extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a consistent format, and loading it into a target data warehouse.  Understanding ETL is essential for building effective data warehouses.",
