      "description": "This topic delves into the process of data profiling, where we analyze the structure, content, and quality of a dataset. You will learn how to identify data types, distributions, missing values, and potential inconsistencies. Understanding these characteristics is crucial for effective data cleaning and transformation.",

      "description": "This topic explores strategies for handling missing data, a common challenge in real-world datasets. You will learn about different imputation techniques, such as mean/median/mode imputation, k-nearest neighbors, and model-based imputation, and understand their strengths and weaknesses. You'll also learn how to evaluate the impact of missing data on your analysis.",

      "description": "This topic focuses on feature engineering, the process of creating new variables from existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models. You will learn about different feature engineering techniques, such as encoding categorical variables, creating interaction terms, and extracting features from text data. This topic emphasizes the importance of domain knowledge and creative thinking in feature engineering.",
